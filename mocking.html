        With Mock::Quick you can mock object instances on the fly, no need for
        a package.

        <script class="code">
            my $obj = qobj(
                method_name1 => 'value',
                method_name2 => qmeth { ... CODE ... },
                method_name3 => sub { "This is a subref as value, not a method" },
            );
        </script>

        This defines an object with 3 methods, the first simply returns a
        value, the second is a custom method, the third returns a subref.

        <script class="code">
            $obj->method_name2( qclear );
        </script>

        This will remove the method code from the method_name2 turning it into
        an empty read/write accessor.

        <script class="code">
            $obj->foo( 'Autovivified Method!' );
        </script>

        Any method you do not define will auto-vivify as a read/write accessor.

        <script class="code">
            my $sobj = qstrict( ... );
        </script>

        This is the same as qobj, except that there is no method
        auto-vivifying.
