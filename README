NAME
    Fennec - Workflow based testing framework for Perl.

DESCRIPTION
    Fennec is a workflow based testing framework for Perl. It is designed to
    be easy to use, easy to extend, and to provide an incredible array of
    tools while staying out of your way. Fennec provides everything your
    used to in Perl testing framework along with enhancements inspired from
    other frameworks.

    Fennec works just like traiditional Test::Builder tools in that it
    allows you to write script style tests. Fennec takes this a step further
    by introducing behavior driven development with the concepts of test
    groups and workflows. Fennec also requires that each test file define a
    class which Fennec will instantiate.

    Please see these docs for additional details:

SYNOPSIS
    t/MyModule.t:

        package TEST::MyModule;
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use Fennec::Standalone;

        use_or_skip 'Dependancy::Module';

        use_ok 'MyModule';

        tests simple {
            can_ok( 'MyModule', 'new' );
            isa_ok( MyModule->new(), 'MyModule' );
            dies_ok { MyModule->Thing_that_dies } "thing dies";
            warning_like { MyModule->Thing_that_warns } qr/.../, "thing warns";

            is_deeply( ... );
            ...
        }

        describe 'RSPEC Tests' {
            # Automatically get $self
            before_each { $self->do_something }
            after_each { $self->do_something_else }

            it test_one {
                ok( 1, "1 is true!" )
            }

            describe nested { ... };
        }

        cases some_primes {
            my $var;
            case two { $var = 2 }
            case three { $var = 3 }

            tests is_prime {
                ok( is_prime($var), "var is prime" )
            }
        }

        done_testing;

MISSION
    Fennec::Mission - Why does Fennec exist?

API DOCUMENTATION
    API Documentation covers object internals. See the POD within each
    individual module.

FENNEC MODULE API
    This section only covers the API for Fennec.pm. See Fennec::Manual and
    other documentation for other module API's.

    This section is not for those who simply wish to write tests, this is
    for people who want to extend Fennec.

  Class methods
    import( %proto )
            use Fennec %proto;

        Called when you use the Fennec module. %proto is key/value pairs for
        configuration. Meta data keys should be placed in a hashref under
        the 'meta' key.

    my $obj = $class->new( %proto )
        Create a new instance. %proto can be all the same key/value pairs as
        import(), except that the meta data must be in a hashref under the
        'meta' key. You must also specify a 'caller' key with an arrayref
        containing a package name, filename, and line number for the test
        file.

  Object methods
    When you use Fennec, it will create an object internally to do some
    initialization and exporting. These are it's methods.

    test_class()
        Returns the test class. This will either be determined by import()
        or provided to import/new via the first element of the arrayref
        provided under the 'caller' key.

    test_file()
        Returns the test filename. This will either be determined by
        import() or provided to import/new via the second element of the
        arrayref provided under the 'caller' key.

    imported_line()
        Returns the line number where fennec was used. This will either be
        determined by import() or provided to import/new via the third
        element of the arrayref provided under the 'caller' key.

    workflows()
        Returns an arrayref containing the workflow names provided at
        import, or if none were provided, then the defaults will be
        provided.

    asserts()
        Returns an arrayref containing the assert names provided at import,
        or if none were provided, then the defaults will be provided.

    root_workflow()
        Returns the classname of the root workflow that will be used.

    subclass()
        Modifies the test classes @ISA array to make it a subclass of
        Fennec::TestFile

    init_meta()
        Initializes the meta object for the test class.

    export_tools()
        Export the basic tools to the test class

    export_workflows()
        Export the desired workflows to the test class

    export_asserts()
        Export the desired asserts to the test class
