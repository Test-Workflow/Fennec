        Fennec imports Child.pm which brings in the 'child {}' function.

        <ul>
            <li>Forking is hard to get right</li>
            <li>Child is an OO interface to fork</li>
            <li>With Child forking is easy</li>
        </ul>

        <script class="code">
            my $child = child {
                my $parent = shift;
                ...
            };

            ...

            $child->wait();
        </script>

        As the above example shows, you do not need to check if you are parent
        or child, you also do not need to worry about closing your child
        process. The child process will run the codeblock, then it will exit.

        <p>

        This is a list of other methods the child object has available.

        <script class="code">
            $child->kill( $SIG )
            $proc->is_complete()
            $proc->wait()
            $proc->kill($SIG)
            $proc->pid()
            $proc->exit_status()
            $proc->unix_exit()
        </script>

        The $parent object also has some helpful methods

        <script class="code">
            $parent->pid
            $parent->detach
        </script>
    </dd>
</dl>
