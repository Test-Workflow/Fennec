Fennec::Manual::Developer - Developer manual for extending or enhancing Fennec.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Guide to developing plugins or enhancements for Fennec.

=head1 CHAPTER 1 - INNER WORKINGS

Fennec starts by loading a runner, even in standalone. This runner does the
following:

=head3 STARTUP PHASE

=over 4

=item Gather process information

=item Take over Test::Builder if needed

=item Start a collector to gather results

=item Initialize output handlers

=item Create a fork controller aka threader (NOT USING THREADS)

Threader should not be confused with perls horrible threading.

=back

=head3 TESTING PHASE

The following is one for each test file the runner finds. For standalone tests
it occurs only once; for only the one file. The runner may do this in multiple
processes, one per file.

=over 4

=item Run test file

Creates test groups and workflow objects, as well as running any package level
asserts.

=item Process Workflows

Workflow codeblocks are run as methods and produce additional test groups.

=item Run all test groups from all workflows

All the test groups defined in the file and the workflows are randomized and
run as methods. The file process may run multiple groups at once in several
processes.

=back

=head3 CLEANUP PHASE

The cleanup phase tears everything down after tests have been run.

=over 4

=item Wait on child prcesses

=item Shutdown output handles

=back

=head2 CHAPTER 1.3 - NAMESPACES

=over 4

=item Fennec

This is the primary Fennec namespace.

=item Fennec::Workflow

This is the namespace for workflow implementations. Things like RSPEC an Case
live here.

=item Fennec::Util

Used for misc utility items.

=item Fennec::TestSet

TestSet is the class used to implement test group methods, and any workflow
test grouping.

=item Fennec::TestFile

The base class for all Fennec test classes. Custom file types may subclass this
for their own base classes.

=item Fennec::Parser

Namespace for Devel::Declare Magic.

=item Fennec::Output

This is where output objects such as results, diag, etc. live. These are the
objects that get serialized and sent to the handlers in the runner.

=item Fennec::Handler

Thi is where output handlers go. These objects take the output objects and
present them to the user in a useful way such as TAP.

=item Fennec::FileType

The namespace for filetype classes which are used to load test files.

=item Fennec::Collector

Namespace for collectors which funnel results to the parent thread.

=item Fennec::Base

This is where various base classes go.

=item Fennec::Assert

This is the namespace for libraries of assert functions.
