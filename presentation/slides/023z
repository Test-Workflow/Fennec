                                    Assertion Library management

 * Every group and workflow generates a result
   * Result passes if the method does not die
   * Result fails if the method dies
   * This allows for 'traditional asserts'

 * Fennec::Assert - Custom assertions or tester functions
   * Easily create libraries of functions similar to Test::More, etc.
   * Automatically fills in result metadata such as:
     * File name
     * Line number

 * Fennec::Util::TBOverride
   * Defangs Test::Builder, forces it to report to Fennec
   * Most Test::Builder tools 'just work' under fennec
   * The most popular tools have been wrapped in Fennec::Assert::TBCore
     * Wrapping Test::Builder tools encapsulates errors and results together
