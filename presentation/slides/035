                                          Fennec::FileType

 * Specify the types of files to load in the runner

 * Each Fennec::FileType::XXX must implement:

   * $bool = $class->valid_file( $filename )

   * $testclass = $class->load_file( $filename )

   * @paths = $class->paths()

  These 3 methods allow Fennec to work with almost any test file format you
  can conceive.
