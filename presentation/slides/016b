 * Often require a 'runner' to take control.

 * Usually do not work well together



For example, Test::Class Uses a .t file to find, load, and run Test::Class tests.

 * If 2 'runners' find files that look the same (t/.../*.pm) they may stomp eachother

 * What if you want to mix multiple workflows?
