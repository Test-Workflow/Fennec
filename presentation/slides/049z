 * Test::Builder::Tester is painful

Capturing and verifying formatted output is a mistake when your writing a tool
that sits at a higher level.




 * Fennec::Assert::Interceptor is pleasant
   * Uses a collector stand-in to capture actual output objects

Fennec tools can be tested using the Fennec Interceptor assertion library. It
lets you capture all output generated in a codeblock. Unlike
Test::Builder::Tester you don't parse output text. What you get is output
objects.
