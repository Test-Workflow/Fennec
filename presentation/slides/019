-- Root Workflow
   |- Test Group
   |- Another Test Group
   |- Child Workflow
   |  |- Test Group
   |  |- ...
   |
   |- Another Child
      |- Test Group

The workflow process:
 * Load file
   * Create root workflow
   * Add workflows and testgroups defined at package level

 * Initialize/Build child workflows
  * Build workflows to depth

 * Get test sets from each workflow to depth
   (Each workflow returns its own groups and the groups of its children)

 * Run test sets (parallelizable)
